The body of the method [`example.VersionedSet.incrementVersion()`](https://github.com/example/example/blob/none/example/src/main/java/example/VersionedSet.java) 
was  removed 
yet,  none of the following tests failed:

*  [`example.VersionedSetTest.testIntersection`](https://github.com/example/example/blob/none/example/src/test/java/example/VersionedSetTest.java)
*  [`example.VersionedSetTest.testAdd`](https://github.com/example/example/blob/none/example/src/test/java/example/VersionedSetTest.java)



It is possible to observe a difference between the program state when the transformed method is executed and the program state when the original method is executed. 
This difference can be observed in [`VersionedSetTest.java`](#L27) from the expression returning a value of type `example.VersionedSet` located  in line 27 from column 25 to column 27 


When the transformation is applied to the method, it was observed that  the field `version` of  the value obtained from the expression was `0` but should have been `1`.

Consider modifying the test to verify the value of `version` in the result of the expression.


Consider verifying the result or side effects of one of the following methods invoked for the result of the expression:

- `example.VersionedSet.getVersion()`
