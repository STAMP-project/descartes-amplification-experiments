he body of the method [`org.xwiki.job.internal.DefaultJobStatusStore.isSerializable(org.xwiki.job.event.status.JobStatus)`](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/blob/23e8a823decc3eec9e20fd5332e78041399e52d1/xwiki-commons-core/xwiki-commons-job/src/main/java/org/xwiki/job/internal/DefaultJobStatusStore.java) 
was  replaced by  `return false;`  
yet,  [`org.xwiki.job.internal.DefaultJobStatusStoreTest.storeJobStatus`](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/blob/23e8a823decc3eec9e20fd5332e78041399e52d1/xwiki-commons-core/xwiki-commons-job/src/test/java/org/xwiki/job/internal/DefaultJobStatusStoreTest.java) did not fail. 

It is possible to observe a difference between the program state when the transformed method is executed and the program state when the original method is executed. This difference is observed right after the method invocation but not from from the top level code of any test.


For one invocation of `isSerializable`, it was observed that the return value  was `false` but should have been `true`.

To solve this problem you may consider to:

* Create a new test case that targets the result of one of the following methods:
    
    - org.xwiki.job.internal.DefaultJobStatusStore.storeAsync(org.xwiki.job.event.status.JobStatus)
    
    - org.xwiki.job.internal.DefaultJobStatusStore.store(org.xwiki.job.event.status.JobStatus)
    
    these are the closest accessible methods that can be used to trigger the execution of `isSerializable`


* Check if the effects of the method are visible from outside the class. Otherwise you may consider to add a visible method (maybe a getter) that could be used to observe the effects of `isSerializable`.

* Refactor the code that uses this method. Maybe the method is not actually needed in the context that it is being used.
