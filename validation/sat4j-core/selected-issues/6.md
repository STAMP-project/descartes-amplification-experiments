The body of the method [`org.sat4j.tools.Minimal4CardinalityModel.model()`](https://gitlab.ow2.org/sat4j/sat4j/blob/8dadb81569350aa5771c71119eaf12833536745e/org.sat4j.core/src/main/java/org/sat4j/tools/Minimal4CardinalityModel.java) 
was  replaced by  `return null;`  
yet,  [`org.sat4j.ModelIteratorTest.testCardModel`](https://gitlab.ow2.org/sat4j/sat4j/blob/8dadb81569350aa5771c71119eaf12833536745e/org.sat4j.core/src/test/java/org/sat4j/ModelIteratorTest.java) did not fail. 


It is possible to observe a difference between the program state when the transformed method is executed and the program state when the original method is executed. 
This difference can be observed in [`ModelIteratorTest.java`](https://gitlab.ow2.org/sat4j/sat4j/blob/8dadb81569350aa5771c71119eaf12833536745e/org.sat4j.core/src/test/java/org/sat4j/ModelIteratorTest.java#L302) from the expression returning a value of type `int[]` located  in line 302 from column 17 to column 31 


When the transformation is applied to the method, it was observed that   the value obtained from the expression was null but should have been non-null.
