The body of the method [`org.sat4j.minisat.core.Solver.reduceDB()`](https://gitlab.ow2.org/sat4j/sat4j/blob/8dadb81569350aa5771c71119eaf12833536745e/org.sat4j.core/src/main/java/org/sat4j/minisat/core/Solver.java) 
was  removed 
yet,  [`org.sat4j.minisat.constraints.TestXor.twoLargeOppositeParity`](https://gitlab.ow2.org/sat4j/sat4j/blob/8dadb81569350aa5771c71119eaf12833536745e/org.sat4j.core/src/test/java/org/sat4j/minisat/constraints/TestXor.java) did not fail. 

When the transformed method is executed, there is no difference with the execution using the original source code. 

This could mean that the method is not producing any side effect. 
Consider creating a modified variant of the  test mentioned  above where the side effects can be observed.
