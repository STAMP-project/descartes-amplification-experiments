When the body of the method [`greycat.internal.task.CoreTaskContextRegistry.reportProgress(java.lang.Integer,greycat.internal.task.CoreProgressReport)`](https://github.com/datathings/greycat/blob/5ced869407f7612517fc354b41516eb300d8a3f1/greycat/src/main/java/greycat/internal/task/CoreTaskContextRegistry.java#L154) 
was  removed 
however,  [`greycatTest.workers.GraphWorkerTest`](https://github.com/datathings/greycat/blob/5ced869407f7612517fc354b41516eb300d8a3f1/greycat/src/test/java/greycatTest/workers/GraphWorkerTest.java) does not fail. 


It is possible to observe a difference between the program state when the transformed method is executed and the program state when the original method is executed. 
This difference can be observed in [`GraphWorkerTest.java`](https://github.com/datathings/greycat/blob/5ced869407f7612517fc354b41516eb300d8a3f1/greycat/src/test/java/greycatTest/workers/GraphWorkerTest.java#L91) from the expression returning a value of type `greycat.Node` located  in line 91 from column 48 to column 69 


When the transformation is applied to the method, it was observed that  the field `threadStatus` of the value obtained from the expression was `657` but should have been `5`.

Consider modifying the test to verify the value of `threadStatus` in the result of the expression.
